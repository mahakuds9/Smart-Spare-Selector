Project Overview: 
This Power BI project analyzes historical ticket data from a technical support system for laptop repairs. The dataset spans over 4 years and includes more than 30,000 support tickets. The primary objective of this project is to leverage data analysis to optimize the decision-making process for technical support agents when ordering replacement parts for laptops with recurring issues.

Key Features:
Part Recommendation System:

Using historical ticket data, Power BI analyzes which parts were ordered and how successful each replacement part was in resolving the issue.
A suggestion mechanism is implemented in the system that identifies and recommends parts with high success rates for similar technical issues.
Agents will be able to see which parts have been proven to resolve specific laptop issues, thus increasing the chances of resolving future tickets more effectively and efficiently.
Agent Performance Analysis:

Another page in the Power BI report displays agent performance metrics, specifically focusing on repeat repairs.
This page tracks which agents are handling recurring issues effectively, and which agents may need further support or training.
By identifying the agents who frequently handle tickets involving repeat repairs, the system helps improve the overall performance and ensures better outcomes for customers.
Data Import & Cleaning Process:

The data for this project is imported from a PostgreSQL database (managed using pgAdmin) into Power BI, where the data was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
This includes extracting relevant columns, filtering out irrelevant or erroneous data, and ensuring that the dataset is complete and accurate before analysis.
Benefits:
Increased Efficiency: The agent part recommendation system saves time and helps agents make informed decisions faster, reducing unnecessary delays in ticket resolution.
Enhanced Success Rate: By recommending parts with high success rates for particular issues, the chances of solving future tickets correctly the first time are significantly improved.
Performance Tracking: The agent performance analysis dashboard provides valuable insights into repeat repairs, allowing for targeted coaching, training, or adjustments in workload distribution to improve performance and reduce the occurrence of recurring problems.
This Power BI report provides a powerful tool for optimizing the repair process and improving customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.
